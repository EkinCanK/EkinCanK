- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EkinCanK

I am discovering new spaces in this phase of my life where i have a lot of time to do what ever i want to.
This page is probably going to be visited only by those who are coming over the link in my CV. So i wish you to enjoy my projects, "Cinema Paris Bildwerferraum App (CP BWR App)" that i coded from scratch and "12 Steps to Navier Stokes in Python" which is offered as an open CFD course by Prof. Lorena Barba (https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython) .
And of course, i would be happy to be given a chance for an interview. 

Bye!
